Welcome to **Majikari マジカリ** — real prices from Japan.

We're building a tool to help you find Japanese figures and merch at the best price across proxy services. This server is for collectors who buy from Japan.

**🔗 Site:** majikari-web.vercel.app
**🛠 What we do:** Search 7,300+ figures, compare proxy costs, find listings on Mercari JP

**Rules:**
1. Be cool to each other
2. No bootleg promotion
3. Share your finds — this community runs on everyone helping everyone
4. Feature requests and bug reports go in #feature-requests and #bug-reports
5. Self-promo is fine in moderation (share your collection, your shop, etc.)

This is early days — your feedback directly shapes what we build next. 🙏
